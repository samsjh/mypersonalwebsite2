          <h3>Design and Development</h3>
          <p>
            I started to learn to code after my first business venture failed at the age of 17. My team was getting ready for a pitch, but realised we needed a working prototype. I realised I could learn how to build the prototype myself. Therefore, I started taking courses on Udemy and watched videos on youtube. Through this experience, I found my passion for programming, and been have improving my skills ever since.

          <h3>Boxing</h3>
          <p class="boxing-row-desc">
           Coming from a background with contact sports, I picked up boxing during the start of covid as I could no longer play rugby due to safe-distancing measures. Boxing is a great sport to train both physical and mental discipline. Boxing has helped me build up positive habits that I apply throughout my life.
